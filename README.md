# cmpe130project

This project is to find the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm

The contents of the graph are: cities and the distance between them

The source file is the code for Dijkstra's algorithm

The code is run through command prompt.

First, set a source location then a destination location.

The city are not seperated by space and capital letter on every two word cities
example: LosAngeles, SanFrancisco, SanDiego
